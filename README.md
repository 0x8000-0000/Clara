A simple to use command line parser for C++

Please note that, for now, this should be considered pre-alpha!
I've pushed it up for people to look at and try out out of curiosity - or perhaps even to help with.
But this version has many short-comings and the interfaces are liable to change - potentially quite significantly.

Some have told me that, compared to their alternatives, even given the above they are prepared to take the hit and use it in their own projects.
That's fine. After all, the impact of a command line parser is comparitively minimal - so even significant changes should be fairly easy to keep up with.
Don't say I didn't warn you though ;-)
