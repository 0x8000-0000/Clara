# Clara 1.0

A simple to use command line parser for C++

Clara is a single-header library.

To use, just `#include "clara.hpp"`

For usage please see the unit tests or look at how it is used in the Catch code-base (catch-lib.net).
Documentation will be coming soon.

## Old version

If you used the earlier, v0.x, version of Clara please note that this is a complete rewrite which assumes C++11 and has
a different interface. Conversion between v0.x and v1.x is a fair simple and mechanical task, but is a bit of manual 
work - so don't take this version until you're ready (and, of course, able to use C++11).

I hope you'll find the new interface an improvement - and this will be built on to offer new features moving forwards.
I don't expect to maintain v0.x any further, but it remains on a branch.
